# State Machine & Safety Policies

The core execution of LoopCode v2 is managed by a state machine that handles planning, execution, verification, and failure feedback loop cascades.

                                  [DONE]
```

## State Transitions & Actions

### 1. PLANNING

- **Action**: Classifier analyzes goal complexity. Bypasses to `single_agent` path if simple. Otherwise, `PlannerAgent` creates task DAG.
- **Transition Target**: `executing`.

### 2. EXECUTING

- **Action**: `DynamicRouter` resolves the optimal model. Pre-call budget is checked via `CostEngine.canSpend()`. Spawns sandboxed `GitWorktreeScheduler` execution.
- **Transition Target**: `verifying`.

### 3. VERIFYING

- **Action**: Executes local checks (compilation, unit testing, linting).
- **Decisions**:
  - _Pass_: Proceed to next task or transition to `done`.
  - _Fail (Retries Left)_: Increment retry attempt and transition back to `executing` with failure evidence injected.
  - _Fail (Retries Exhausted)_: Transition back to `planning` to re-plan the remaining steps.

## Safety Engines & Policies

### 1. Loop Oscillation Detection

Before executing a state transition, the `LoopDetector` constructs a SHA-256 signature hash of the current orchestrator state:

```typescript
const sig = {
  phase: taskRecord.state,
  taskIndex: taskRecord.current_task_index,
  filesChanged: [...files],
  retryAttempt: attempts,
};
```

If an identical state signature is encountered twice (indicating no progress is being made), the execution is immediately aborted to prevent runaway LLM costs.

### 2. Budget Enforcement

Before spawning any model execution, the `CostEngine` validates estimated costs. If a breach is detected, it terminates the CLI session with a custom **exit code 77**:

```typescript
process.exit(77);
```

This allows external wrappers or schedulers to catch budget exhaustion explicitly.

### 3. SQLite Persistence & Crash Recovery

Every transition is saved to `loopcode.db`. In case of a system crash, you can resume execution using:

```bash
node dist/index.js --resume <task-uuid>
```
